In the end of September this year, I started working at a ad-tech company.
Here i was aware that there are so many things i haven't know yet, so i decided to create a blog that i can note share these new knowledges with you guys.
Because this is the first blog. So I'll list things that i want to write and share from now on.

* Back to basic:
  * Pointer
  * Things to avoid in C
* Create a simple spring boot.
* Create a simple blog by jekyll =)) (that i spend all night on)
* Build some simple program in order predict house price based on what i learned.
* My most useful commands in vim.
