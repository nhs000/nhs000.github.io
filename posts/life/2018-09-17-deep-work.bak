* 1. Work deeply
**  1a. Decide on Your Depth Philosophy
1. The Monastic Philosophy: isolate themselves from shallow obligations in order to do their work (1year/1year)
2. The Bimodal Philosophy: split their work year into deep work periods in isolation, along with shallow work periods engaged in more normal activities (0.5year/1year)
3. The Rhythmic Philosophy: practitioners of this philosophy set aside a specific time each day to engage in Deep Work, and defend this time aggressively (0.5day/1day)
4. The Journalistic Philosophy: (few hours/preriod)

** 1b. Consider the following factors when creating your ritual
1. Where you’ll work and for how long
2. How you’ll work once you start to work: Maintain a metric like words produced per twenty minute interval ...
3. How you’ll support your work: Figure out what’s necessary to support you in successfully finishing your allocated deep work time

* 2. Make Grand Gestures
Create environment to perform deep-work.
